DEPRECIATED: League of Legends has changed their Runes
system so this program will no longer work as of 2018.

LeagueRM
Input:	region, summonerName, championName, APIKey
Output:	Last 5 rune pages used on Champion by Summoner

The output goes to the CMD and SQLite database file named LeagueDB

The reason the program is called LeagueRM is because I was originally
going to do Runes&Masteries. I have decided not to do Masteries at this
time as it would look hideous with a text UI. I might change my mind
in the future, so I have decided to keep the name LeagueRM.

Riot limits how many API calls you can use. This program uses 7 in
quick succession. This can often leads to problems, simply retrying
the program after a short delay usually gets around these issues.

Below is what I used the RIOT API calls for.

# requestSummonerData [1x]
summoner-v1.4
INPUT:	region, summonerName
OUTPUT: summonerId

# requestChampionData [1x] - NO LIMIT
lol-static-data-v1.2
INPUT:	championName
OUTPUT:	championId

# requestChampionHistory [1x]
matchlist-v2.2
INPUT:	summonerId, region, championId
ONTPUT:	matchIds

# requestGameMatch [5x]
match-v2.2
INPUT:	region, matchId
OUTPUT:	rank, runeId

# requestRuneData [VARIESx] - NO LIMIT
lol-static-data-v1.2
INPUT:	runeId
OUTPUT:	runeName
